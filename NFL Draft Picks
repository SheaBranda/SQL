#In this SQL I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about NFL draft pick data.

# I used Data from the first 3 round of the 2016 NFL Draft


#1
--Determine the names of the first ten players drafted in the 2015 NFL draft
SELECT * FROM picks WHERE pick_number < 10;

#2
--Determine if any players were Offensive Guard and went to Louisville
SELECT * FROM picks WHERE college = "Louisville" AND position = "OG"
;

#3
--Determine the total # of quarterbacks in the 2015 NFL draft
SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Total Quarterbacks in List" FROM picks WHERE position = "QB"

#4
--Order players name alphabetically
SELECT name
FROM "picks"
ORDER BY name asc

#5
--Determine the top 10 picks and who they were picked by
SELECT name, pick_number, picked_by
FROM picks
order by pick_number asc
limit 10;
